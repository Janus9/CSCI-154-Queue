# TLDR of changes
# I made a simple console design for it to showcase it running, the queue has a chance to add a customer every tick
# after serving a customer, sim decides random time between user input min/max for how long it takes to serve the new customer
# the sim time is ticks/second, so increasing this without decreasing the arrival_prob will increase the # of customers since its per tick



# 4. Loop over each time step
#   a. Decide if a customer arrives (use random)
#       - if yes, add them to the queue with their arrival time and service time
#   b. If the server is free and the queue is not empty:
#       - remove the next customer
#       - calculate their wait time
#       - update stats
#       - set the server as busy until service ends
#   c. Record the queue length at this time

# 5. After the loop:
# - calculate average wait time
# this is total wait time divided by customers served
# - print total customers served, average wait, etc.

# Resume, Pause, Start, End Controls in TKinter (not implemented here)

# 6. Plot the queue length over time using matplotlib
# - label axes, title, grid, and show the plot



# SIMULATION RULESET:
# Arrivals:
# Customers arrive randomly, controlled by an arrival probability per time unit (set by the user).
# Service:
#   There is a single server (e.g., cashier/teller).
#   Each customerâ€™s service time is randomly chosen between a user-set minimum and maximum.
# Queue:
#   Arriving customers join the line.
#   The server serves the next customer in the queue when available.
#   When a customer is done being served, they leave the system.
# User Controls:
#   The simulation allows users to adjust:
#   Arrival probability
#   Minimum and maximum service times
#   Start, pause, and reset the simulation
# Visualization:
#   The simulation shows the queue as dots (customers) lined up, with the customer being served highlighted.
#   A live graph displays the queue length over time.
#   Live stats show time, number in queue, customers served, and average wait time
